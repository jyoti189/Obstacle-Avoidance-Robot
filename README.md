# Obstacle-Avoidance-Robot
An obstacle avoiding robot is an intelligent device, which can automatically sense and overcome obstacles on its path and protect the robot from any physical damages. 
IR module is used to avoid the obstacle if it comes in front of IR module. 
The idea is simple and works without micro controller. 
That means we can make it without any sort of coding and the circuit allows us to use any DC motor regardless of its power, so even high power obstacle avoiding 
vehicles could be made using this circuit which are normally used in malls and similar retail outlets.
